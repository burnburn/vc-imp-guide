      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
        Welcome dear implementer of Verifiable Credentials! We understand that reading
        and nagivating technical specifications can be confusing at times. For this reason,
        we would like to offer you a few resources to get you started.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you should probably become familiarized with the official
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/verifiable-claims-use-cases/">Use Cases document</a>,
        which offers a concise but limited collection of use cases readers should review before
        undestanding how Verifiable Claims can best help them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">data model specification</a> is the
        most important result of two years of hard work done by the Verifiable Claims Working Group.
        However, the data model itself is not sufficient if you plan to use Verifiable Claims today.
        Additional works needs to be done on identifiers as well as on proofs, as you will be able to
        find out in the sections below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Identifiers</h2>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>
      <p>
          When expressing statements about a specific entity, such as a person, product, or organization,
          it is often useful to use some kind of identifier so that others can express statements about
          the same thing. You may have noticed that the VC Data Model specification contains numerous
          examples where the choice of identifier for the subject of the credential (the thing the claims
          are about) has been a <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/">decentralized identifier</a>,
          also known as a DID. An example of a DID is <code>did:example:123456abcdef</code>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
          As of the publication of the VC Data Model specification, DIDs are a new type of identifier that
          are not necessary for verifiable credentials to be useful. Specifically, verifiable credentials
          do not depend on DIDs and DIDs do not depend on verifiable credentials. However, it is expected
          that many verifiable credentials will use DIDs and that software libraries implementing the Data Model
          specification will probably need to resolve DIDs. DID-based URLs are used for expressing identifiers
          associated with subjects, issuers, holders, credential status lists, cryptographic keys, and other
          machine-readable information that is associated with a verifiable credential.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is currently a proposed charter for a new <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-wg-charter/">
        Decentralized Identifier Working Group</a> that has been submitted to the W3C, aiming to officially
        put DIDs on the standards track.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Proofs</h2>
      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
          The VC Data Model is designed to be proof format agnostic. At the time of publication,
          at least two proof formats are being actively utilized by implementers -- JSON Web Token (JWT)
          and Linked Data Proofs.
          The Working Group felt that <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#proof-formats">documenting</a>
          in the spec what these proof formats are and how they are being used would be beneficial to implementers.

      </p>
      <p>
        The table below compares three syntax and proof format ecosystems; JSON+JWTs, JSON-LD+JWTs,
        and JSON-LD+LD-Proofs. Implementers should be aware that Zero-Knowledge Proofs are currently
        proposed as a sub-type of LD-Proofs and thus fall into the final column below.

                </dt>
                <dd>
          An <em>open world data model</em> is one where any entity can make any
          statement about anything while simultaneously ensuring that the semantics of
          the statement are unambiguous. This specification is enabled by an open world
          data model called Linked Data. One defining characteristic of supporting an open
          world data model is the ability to specify the semantic context in which data
          is being expressed. JSON-LD provides this mechanism via the
          <code>@context</code> property. JSON has no such feature.

                </dt>
                <dd>
          All entities in a JSON-LD document are identified either via an automatic URI,
          or via an explicit URI. This enables all entities in a document to be
          unambiguously referenced. JSON does not have a native URI type nor does it
          require objects to have one, making it difficult to impossible to unambiguously
          identify an entity expressed in JSON.

                </dt>
                <dd>
          JSON object properties are not mapped to IRIs, which result in ambiguities with
          respect to the semantic meaning of the property. For example, one JSON document
          can use "title" (meaning "book title") in a way that is semantically
          incompatible with another JSON document using "title" (meaning "job title").
          In contrast, each object property in a JSON-LD document, such as the property
          "homepage", is either a keyword, an IRI, or a literal mapped to an IRI via a context.
          This feature enables open world systems to identify the semantic meaning of the
          property in an unambiguous way, which enables seamless merging of data between
          disparate systems.

                <dd>
          JSON-LD provides a mechanism that enables a data value to use a URL to refer
          to data outside of the local document. This external data may then be
          automatically merged with the local document without a merge conflict in
          semantics or structure. This feature enables a system to apply the
          "follow your nose" principle to discover a richer set of data that is
          associated with the local document. While a JSON document can contain pointers
          to external data, interpreting the pointer is often application specific and
          usually does not support merging the external data to construct a richer data
          set.

          A signature set is an unordered set of signatures over a data payload. Use
          cases, such as cryptographic signatures applied to a legal contract,
          typically require more than one signature to be associated with the contract
          in order to legally bind two or more parties under the terms of the contract.
          LD-Proofs, including LD-Signatures, natively support sets of
          signatures. JWTs only enable a single signature over a single payload.

          When developers are debugging software systems, it is beneficial for them to be
          able to see the data that they are operating on using common debugging tools.
          Similarly, it is useful to be able to serialize data from the network to a
          database and then from the database back out to the network using a minimal
          number of pre- and post-processing steps. LD-Proofs enable developers to use
          common JSON tooling without having to convert the format into a different
          format or structure. Payload information in JWTs is base-64 encoded, and requires
          complicated pre- and post-processing steps to convert the data into JSON data
          while not destroying the digital signature. Similarly, schema-less databases,
          which are typically used to index JSON data, cannot index information
          that is expressed in an opaque base-64 encoded wrapper.

          When a JWT is encapsulated by another JWT, the entire payload must be base-64

          JWT. This is often necessary when a cryptographic signature is required on a
          document that contains a cryptographic signature, such as when a Notary
          signs a document that has been signed by someone else seeking the Notary's
          services. LD-Proofs use an equally secure canonicalization process that requires
          only the cryptographic signature to be base-64 encoded; i.e., LD-Proofs do
          not require that the signed portion of a document also be base-64 encoded.

        <h3>Disputes</h3>

        <p>
  There are at least two different cases to consider where an <a>entity</a>
  wants to dispute a <a>credential</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a>:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
  A <a>subject</a> disputes a claim made by the <a>issuer</a>. For example, the
  <code>address</code> <a>property</a> is incorrect or out of date.
          </li>
          <li>
  An <a>entity</a> disputes a potentially false claim made by the <a>issuer</a>
  about a different <a>subject</a>. For example, an imposter claims the social
  security number for an <a>entity</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
  The mechanism for issuing a <code>DisputeCredential</code> is the same as
  for a regular <a>credential</a>, except that the <code>credentialSubject</code>
  identifier in the <code>DisputeCredential</code> property is the identifier of
  the disputed <a>credential</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
  For example, if a <a>credential</a> with an identifier of
  <code>https://example.org/credentials/245</code> is disputed, an <a>entity</a>
  can issue one of the <a>credentials</a> shown below. In the first example, the
  <a>subject</a> might present this to the <a>verifier</a> along with the disputed
  <a>credential</a>. In the second example, the <a>entity</a> might publish the
  <code>DisputeCredential</code> in a public venue to make it known that the
  <a>credential</a> is disputed.

      <h2>Extensions</h2>

      <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed around an <em>open world
assumption</em>, meaning that entity can say anything about any entity. This
approach enables permissionless innovation; there is no centralized registry
or authority through which an extension author must register themselves or
the specific data models and vocabularies they create.
      </p>

      <p>
Instead, credential data model authors are expected to use machine-readable
vocabularies through the use of [LINKED-DATA]. This implementation guide
provides examples for how to express data models using a data format that
is popular with software developers and web page authors called [JSON-LD]. This
data format provides features that enable authors to express their data models
in idiomatic JSON whilst also ensuring that their vocabulary terms are
unambigiously understood, even by software that does not implement
JSON-LD processing.
      </p>

      <p>
The Verifiable Credentials data model also uses a graph-based data model,
which allows authors to model both simple relationships that describe
one or more attributes for a single entity or complex multi-entity
relationships.
      </p>

      <p>
The rest of this section describes how to author extensions that build on
top of the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Creating New Credential Types</h3>

        <p>
The most common extensions to the Verifiable Credentials Data Model are
new credential types. Whenever someone has something to say about one or
more entities and they want their authorship to be verifiable, they should use
a Verifiable Credential. Sometimes there may be an existing credential type,
that someone else has created, that can be reused to make the statements they
want to make. However, there are often cases where new credential types are
needed.
        </p>

        <p>
New credential types can be created by following a few steps. This guide will
also walk you through creating an example new credential type. At a high level,
the steps to follow are:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
Design the data model.
          </li>
          <li>
Create a new JSON-LD context.
          </li>
          <li>
Select a publishing location.
          </li>
          <li>
Use the new JSON-LD context when issuing new credentials.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
So, let's walk through creating a new credential type which we will
call <code>ExampleAddressCredential</code>. The purpose of this credential
will be to express a person's postal address.
        </p>

        <h4>Design the data model</h4>

        <p>
First, we must design a data model for our new credential type. We know that
we will need to be able to express the basics of a postal address, things
like a person's city, state, and zipcode. Of course, those items are quite
US centric, so we should consider internationalizing those terms. But before
we go further, since we're using [LINKED-DATA] vocabularies, there is a good
chance that commonly known concepts may already have a vocabulary that someone
else has created that we can leverage.
        </p>

        <p>
If we are going to use someone else's vocabulary, we will want to make sure it
is stable and unlikely to change in any significant way. There may even be
technologies that we can make use of that store immutable vocabularies that
we can reference, but those will not be focus in this example. Here we will
rely on the inertia that comes from a very popularly used vocabulary on the
Web, schema.org. It turns out that this vocabulary has just what we need; it
has already modeled a postal address and even has examples for how to express
it using JSON-LD.
        </p>

        <p>
Using the schema.org vocabulary and JSON-LD we can express a person's address
like so:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example schema.org address">
          {
            <span class="highlight">
            "@context": [
              "http://schema.org"
            ]</span>,
            "type": "Person",
            "address": {
              "type": "PostalAddress",
              "streetAddress": "123 Main St."
              "addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
              "addressRegion": "VA",
              "postalCode": "24060",
              "addressCountry": "US"
            }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
Note the above <code>@context</code> key in the JSON. This <code>@context</code>
refers to a machine-readable file (also expressed in JSON) that provides
term definitions [JSON-LD]. A term definition maps a key or type used in the
JSON, such as <code>address</code> or <code>PostalAddress</code>, to a globally
unique identifier: a URL.
        </p>

        <p>
This ensures that when software sees the <code>@context</code>
<em>http://schema.org</em>, that it will interpret the the keys and types in the
JSON in a globally unique way, without requiring developers to use full URLs in
the JSON or in their code that may traverse it. As long as the software is
aware of the specific <code>@context</code> used (or if it uses JSON-LD
processing to transform it to some other known <code>@context</code>), then it
will understand the <em>context</em> in which the JSON was written and meant to
be understood. The use of <code>@context</code> also allows [JSON-LD] keywords
such as <code>@type</code> to be aliased to the simpler <code>type</code> as
is done in the above example.
        </p>

        <p>
Note that we could also express the JSON using full URLs, if we want to avoid
using <em>@context</em>. Here is what the example would look like if we did
that:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example schema.org address with full URLs">
          {
            "@type": "http://schema.org/Person",
            "http://schema.org/address": {
              "@type": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
              "http://schema.org/streetAddress": "123 Main St."
              "http://schema.org/addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
              "http://schema.org/addressRegion": "VA",
              "http://schema.org/postalCode": "24060",
              "http://schema.org/addressCountry": "US"
            }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
While this form is an acceptable way to express the information such that it is
unambiguous, many software developers would prefer to use more idiomatic JSON.
The use of <code>@context</code> enables idiomatic JSON without losing global
uniqueness and without the need for a centralized registry or authority for
creating extensions. Note that <code>@context</code> can also have more than
one value. In this case, a JSON array is used to express multiple values, where
each value references another context that defines terms. Using this mechanism
we can first bring in the terms defined in the Verifiable Credentials Data Model
specification and then bring in the terms defined by schema.org:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example address credential with schema.org context">
          {
            <span class="highlight">
            "@context": [
              "https://www.w3.org/credentials/v1",
              "http://schema.org"
            ]</span>,
            ...
            "credentialSubject": {
              "type": "Person",
              "address": {
                "type": "PostalAddress",
                "streetAddress": "123 Main St."
                "addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
                "addressRegion": "VA",
                "postalCode": "24060",
                "addressCountry": "US"
              }
            },
            ...
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
Note, however, that each <em>context</em> might have a different definition for
the same term, e.g., the JSON key <code>address</code> might map to a different
URL in each <em>context</em>. By default, [JSON-LD] allows terms in a
<code>@context</code> to be redefined using a <em>last term wins</em>
order. While these changes can be safely dealt with by using JSON-LD
processing, we want to lower the burden on consumers of Verifiable Credentials.
We want consumer software to be able to make assumptions about the meaning of
terms by only having to read and understand the string value associated with
the <code>@context</code> key. We don't want them to have to worry about terms
being redefined in unexpected ways. That way their software can inspect only
the <code>@context</code> values and then be hard coded to understand the
meaning of the terms.
        </p>

        <p>
In order to prevent term redefinition, the [JSON-LD] <code>@protected</code>
feature must be applied to term definitions in the <code>@context</code>. All
all terms in the core Verifiable Credentials <code>@context</code> are
already protected in this way. The only time that an existing term is allowed
to be redefined is if the new definition is scoped underneath another new term
that is defined in a <em>context</em>. This matches developer expectations and
ensures that consumer software has strong guarantees about the semantics of the
data it is processing; it can be written such that it is never confused about
the definition of a term. Note that consumers must determine their own risk
profile for how to handle any credentials their software processes that include
terms that it does not understand.
        </p>

        <h4>Create a new JSON-LD context</h4>

        <p>
Given the above, there is at least one reason why we don't want to use
the schema.org <em>context</em>: it is designed to be very flexible and thus
does not use the <code>@protected</code> feature. There are a few of other
reasons we want to create our own [JSON-LD] context though. First, the
schema.org context does not define our new credential type:
<em>ExampleAddressCredential</em>. Second, it is not served via a secure
protocol (e.g., <em>https</em>), rather it uses <em>http</em>. Note that this
is less of a concern than it may seem, as it is recommended that all Verifiable
Credential consumer software hard code the <code>@context</code> values it
understands and not reach out to the Web to fetch them. Lastly, it is a very
large context, containing many more term definitions than are necessary for our
purposes.
        </p>

        <p>
So, we will create our own [JSON-LD] context that expresses just those term
definitions that we need for our new credential type. Note that this does not
mean that we must mint new URLs; we can still reuse the schema.org vocabulary
terms. All we are doing is creating a more concise and targeted context. Here's
what we'll need in our context:
        </p>

        <pre class="example nohighlight" title="Example address credential context">
          {
            "@version": 1.1,
            "@protected": true,

            "ExampleAddressCredential":
              "https://example.org/ExampleAddressCredential",

            "Person": {
              "@id": "http://schema.org/Person",
              "@context": {
                "@version": 1.1,
                "@protected": true,

                "address": "http://schema.org/address"
              }
            },
            "PostalAddress": {
              "@id": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
              "@context": {
                "@version": 1.1,
                "@protected": true,

                "streetAddress": "http://schema.org/streetAddress",
                "addressLocality": "http://schema.org/addressLocality",
                "addressRegion": "http://schema.org/addressRegion",
                "postalCode": "http://schema.org/postalCode",
                "addressCountry": "http://schema.org/addressCountry"
              }
            }
          }
        </pre>

        <p>
The above context defines a term for our new credential type
<em>ExampleAddressCredential</em>, mapping it to the URL
<em>https://example.org/ExampleAddressCredential</em>. We could have also
chosen a URI like <em>urn:private-example:ExampleAddressCredential</em>, but
this approach would not allow us to serve up a Web page to describe it, if we
so desire. The context also defines the terms for types <em>Person</em> and
<em>PostalAddress</em>, mapping them to their schema.org vocabulary URLs.
Furthermore, when those types are used, it also defines protected terms for
each of them via a <em>scoped context</em>, mapping terms like <em>address</em>
and <em>streetAddress</em> to their schema.org vocabulary URLs. For more
information on how to write a JSON-LD context or <em>scoped contexts</em>, see
the [JSON-LD] specification.
        </p>

        <h4>Select a publishing location</h4>

        <p>
Now that we have a [JSON-LD] context, we must give it a URL. Technically
speaking, we could just use a URI, for example, a private URN such as
<em>urn:private-example:my-extension</em>. However, if we want people to be
able to read and discover it on the Web, we should give it a URL like
<em>https://example.org/example-address-credential-context/v1</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
When software dereferences this URL, it should return
<em>application/ld+json</em> by default, to allow JSON-LD processors to process
the context. However, if a user agent requests <em>HTML</em> it should return
human readable text that explains, to humans, what the term definitions are and
what they map to. Since we're reusing an existing vocabulary, schema.org, we
can also simply link to the definitions of the meaning of our types and terms
via their website. If we had created our own new vocabulary terms, we would
describe them on our own site, ideally including machine readable Information
as well.
        </p>

        <h4>Use the new JSON-LD context when issuing new credentials</h4>

        <p>
Now we're ready for our context to be used by either us or someone else
that wishes to issue an <em>ExampleAddressCredential</em>!

        <p>
Extension authors are urged to publish two types of information at the
context URLs. The first type of information is for machines, and is the
machine-readable JSON-LD Context. The second type of information is for
humans, and should be an HTML document. It is suggested that the default
mode of operation is to serve the machine-readable JSON-LD Context as that is
the primary intended use of the URL. If content-negotiation is supported,
requests for <code>text/html</code> should result in a human readable document.
The human readable document should at least contain usage information for the
extension, such as the expected order of URLs associated with the
<code>@context</code> property, specifications that elaborate on the extension,
and examples of typical usage of the extension.

PF1: Support for open world data modelling

          <dd>
An <em>open world data model</em> is one where any entity can make any
statement about anything while simultaneously ensuring that the semantics of
the statement are unambiguous. This specification is enabled by an open world
data model called Linked Data. One defining characteristic of supporting an open
world data model is the ability to specify the semantic context in which data
is being expressed. JSON-LD provides this mechanism via the
<code>@context</code> property. JSON has no such feature.

PF2: Universal identifier mechanism for JSON objects via the use of URIs.
          </dt>
          <dd>
All entities in a JSON-LD document are identified either via an automatic URI,
or via an explicit URI. This enables all entities in a document to be
unambiguously referenced. JSON does not have a native URI type nor does it
require objects to have one, making it difficult to impossible to unambiguously
identify an entity expressed in JSON.

PF3: A way to disambiguate properties shared among different JSON documents by
mapping them to IRIs via a context.
          </dt>
          <dd>
All object properties in a JSON-LD document, such as the property "homepage",
are either keywords or they are mapped to an IRI. This feature enables open
world systems to identify the semantic meaning of the property in an unambiguous
way, which enables seamless merging of data between disparate systems.
JSON object properties are not mapped to IRIs, which result in ambiguities with
respect to the semantic meaning of the property. For example, one JSON document
might use "title" (meaning "book title") in a way that is semantically
incompatible with another JSON document using "title" (meaning "job title").

          <dd>
JSON-LD provides a mechanism that enables a data value to use a URL to refer
to data outside of the local document. This external data may then be
automatically merged with the local document without a merge conflict in
semantics or structure. This feature enables a system to apply the
"follow your nose" principle to discover a richer set of data that is
associated with the local document. While a JSON document can contain pointers
to external data, interpreting the pointer is often application specific and
usually does not support merging the external data to construct a richer data
set.

JSON-LD's abstract data model supports the expression of information
as a directed graph of labeled nodes and edges, which enables an open world

A signature set is an unordered set of signatures over a data payload. Use
cases, such as cryptographic signatures applied to a legal contract,
typically require more than one signature to be associated with the contract
in order to legally bind two or more parties under the terms of the contract.
Linked Data Proofs, including Linked Data Signatures, natively support sets of
signatures. JWTs only enable a single signature over a single payload.

All major search crawlers natively parse and index information expressed as
JSON-LD in HTML pages. LD-Proofs enable the current data format that search
engines use to be extended to support digital signatures. JWTs have no mechanism
to express data in HTML pages and are currently not indexed by search crawlers.

PF10: Data on the wire is easy to debug and serialize to database systems.
          </dt>
          <dd>
When developers are debugging software systems, it is beneficial for them to be
able to see the data that they are operating on using common debugging tools.
Similarly, it is useful to be able to serialize data from the network to a
database and then from the database back out to the network using a minimal
number of pre and post processing steps. LD-Proofs enable developers to use
common JSON tooling without having to convert the format into a different
format or structure. JWTs base-64 encode payload information, resulting in
complicated pre and post processing steps to convert the data into JSON data
while not destroying the digital signature. Similarly, schema-less databases,
which are typically used to index JSON data, cannot index information
that is expressed in an opaque base-64 encoded wrapper.

PF11: Nesting signed data does not cause data size to double for every

          </dt>
          <dd>
When a JWT is encapsulated by another JWT, the entire payload must be base-64
encoded in the initial JWT, and then base-64 encoded again in the encapsulating
JWT. This is often necessary when a cryptographic signature is required on a
document that contains a cryptographic signature, such as when a Notary
signs a document that has been signed by someone else seeking the Notary's
services. LD-Proofs do not require base-64 encoding the signed portion of a
document and instead rely on a canonicalization process that is just as
secure, and that only requires the cryptographic signature to be encoded
instead of the entire payload.

PF12: Proof format supports Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

          <dd>
The LD-Proof format is capable of modifying the algorithm that generates
the hash or hashes that are cryptographically signed. This cryptographic
agility enables digital signature systems, such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs,
to be layered on top of LD-Proofs instead of an entirely new digital signature
container format to be created. JWTs are designed such that an entirely new
digital signature container format will be required to support Zero-Knowledge
Proofs.

PF13: Proof format supports arbitrary proofs such as Proof of Work, Timestamp
Proofs, and Proof of Stake.

          <dd>
The LD-Proof format was designed with a broader range of proof types in mind
and supports cryptographic proofs beyond simple cryptographic signatures.
These proof types are in common usage in systems such as decentralized ledgers
and provide additional guarantees to
<a>verifiable credentials</a>, such as the ability to prove that a particular
claim was made at a particular time or that a certain amount of energy was
expended to generate a particular credential. The JWT format does not support
arbitrary proof formats.

PF14: Proofs can be expressed unmodified in other data syntaxes such as XML,
YAML, N-Quads, and CBOR.
          </dt>
          <dd>
The LD-Proof format utilizes a canonicalization algorithm to generate a
cryptographic hash that is used as an input to the cryptographic proof
algorithm. This enables the bytes generated as the cryptographic proof to be
compact and expressible in a variety of other syntaxes such as XML,
YAML, N-Quads, and CBOR. Since JWTs require the use of JSON to be generated,
they are inextricably tied to the JSON syntax.

PF15: Changing property-value ordering, or introducing whitespace does not
invalidate signature.
          </dt>
          <dd>
Since LD-Proofs utilize a canonicalization algorithm, the introduction of
whitespace that does not change the meaning of the information being expressed
has no effect on the final cryptographic hash over the information. This means
that simple changes in whitespace formatting, such as those changes made when
writing data to a schema-less database and then retrieving the same information
from the same database do not cause the digital signature to fail. JWTs
encode the payload using the base-64 format which is not resistant to
whitespace formatting that has no effect on the information expressed. This
shortcoming of JWTs make it challenging to, for example, express signed data in
web pages that search crawlers index.

PF16: Designed to easily support experimental signature systems.

          <dd>
The LD-Proof format is naturally extensible, not requiring the format to be
extended in a formal international standards working group in order to
prevent namespace collisions. The JWT format requires entries in a centralized
registry in order to avoid naming collisions and does not support
experimentation as easily as the LD-Proof format does. LD-Proof format
extension is done through the decentralized publication of cryptographic
suites that are guaranteed to not conflict with other LD-Proof
extensions. This approach enables developers to easily experiment with new
cryptographic signature mechanisms that support selective disclosure,
zero-knowledge proofs, and post-quantum algorithms.

PF17: Supports signature chaining.

          <dd>
A signature chain is an ordered set of signatures over a data payload. Use
cases, such as cryptographic signatures applied to a notarized document,
typically require a signature by the signing party and then an additional one
by a notary to be made after the original signing party has made their
signature. Linked Data Proofs, including Linked Data Signatures, natively
support chains of signatures. JWTs only enable a single signature over a
single payload.

The JWT format utilizes a simple base-64 encoding format to generate the
cryptographic hash of the data. The encoding format for LD-Proofs require
a more complex canonicalization algorithm to generate the cryptographic
hash. The benefits of the JWT approach are simplicity at the cost of
encoding flexibility. The benefits of the LD-Proof approach are flexibility at
the cost of implementation complexity.

The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed to be compatible with a
variety of existing and emerging digital proof formats. Each
proof format has benefits and drawbacks. For instance, many proof formats
cannot reveal selected attribute values in a verifiable credential;
they can only reveal all (or none).
        </p>
        <p>
Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are a proof format that enables
privacy-preserving and data-minimization features in
verifiable presentations, such as selective disclosure and predicate proofs.
        </p>
        <p>
Selective disclosure is the ability of a holder to reveal a subset of
the attributes of a verifiable credential in a verifiable presentation.
A presentation based on zero-knowledge proof mechanisms only contains
those attributes and associated values that are required to satisfy
the presentation requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
Zero-knowledge predicate proofs are a type of proof associated with
an attribute. Predicate proofs include comparisons, such as
"greater than", "less than", "not equal", "range",
"set membership", and "set non-membership".
Predicate proofs can be constructed without requiring the issuer
to create special fields, such as
"age-under-18", "age-over-21", or "age-over-60", in the verifiable credential
at the time the credential was issued.
For example, if a holder has a credential with a "birth-date" claim,
the holder can create a predicate proof based on "birth-date" in the
verifiable presentation. A predicate value derived from "birth-date" in
the verifiable credential can cryptographically prove to the verifier that
the holder's age is greater (or less) than a specified number, without
revealing the holder's "birth-date".
        </p>
        <p>
Verifiable credentials based on zero-knowledge proof mechanisms are
also quantum-resistant after presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
A drawback of zero-knowledge proof mechanisms is that they are
more complex and larger than some older signature schemes.
